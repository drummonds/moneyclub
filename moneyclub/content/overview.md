# Money Club - Building financial resilience

I have just finished a great hackathon focused on the cost of living crisis. One of the major banks stated that 48% of their customers were one paycheck away from hardship. Building financial resilience is the aim of this project.

Alison from EY came up with a ProEmpt name for a model to convert your financial data to resilience and to start to build practical steps to build resilience.

Plese contact me at linked in if you want to help start this journey.
